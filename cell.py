# Peers communicate with one another, and with users via a TLS communication with ephemeral keys.
# Using TLS conceals the data on the connection with perfect forward secrecy, and prevents an
# attacker from modifying data on the wire. Traffic passes along these connections in fixed-size cells.

# Each cell is 4096 bytes, and consists of a header and a payload. The header includes a circuit
# identifier (circID) that specifies which circuit the cell refers to (many circuits can be multiplexed
# over the single TLS connection), and a command to describe what to do with the cellâ€™s payload

# commands :
#   new_peer
#   get_peers
#   peers
